Two goals when initially looking at this data
1.  Is there any trend in the data?
2.  Are there interesting stats for a given year or day?

Following weather types are included in the data:
1.  PRCP = Water equivalen precipitation
2.  SNOW = Snow precipitation
3.  SNWD = Amount of accumulated snow
4.  TMAX = High temp for day
5.  TMIN = Low temp for day

First tab shows density plot, dot plot, and scatterplot for the range of dates.  App defaults to last 10 years, but this can be changed to include all 50.

Second tab shows many interesting statistics as well as the averages for each year in a scatterplot.

Changing any date range, day, month, or year will dynamically change the graphs or table as needed.
